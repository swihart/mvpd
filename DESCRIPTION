Description: Estimates multivariate subgaussian stable densities 
    and probabilities as well as generates random variates using product 
    distribution theory.  A function for estimating the parameters from 
    data to fit a distribution to data is also provided, using the 
    method from Nolan (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-013-0396-7>.
